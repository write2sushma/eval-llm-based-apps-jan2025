### Presentation: [{ YOUR PRESENTATION NAME }](workshop/presentation_template.pdf)

## Workshop description
Describe why your topic is important and what you want to share with your audience

## Requirements
PyLadies Amsterdam uses [uv](https://astral.sh/blog/uv) for dependency management. For installation instructions, please check the [official documentation](https://astral.sh/blog/uv) or the [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/uv/).

## Usage
To get started, open the `pyproject.toml` file and set the required Python version. The pre-selected version 3.8 is generally a safe choice for most use cases.

After you have specified the Python version, you can create a virtual environment with `uv venv` and add packages with `uv add <package>`. Before the workshop, you can generate a requirements.txt file, which is needed e.g. for running code in GoogleColab, by running `uv export > requirements.txt`.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

To ensure our code looks beautiful, PyLadies uses pre-commit hooks. You can enable them by running `pre-commit install`. You may have to install `pre-commit` first, using `uv sync`, `uv pip install pre-commit` or `pip install pre-commit`.
