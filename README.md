# Evaluating LLM based applications

## Workshop description
It is so easy and quick to build a shiny PoC using LLMs and it is so hard to turn it into a production-grade LLM application. To succeed you need a robust evaluation framework, which you are going to use during the development and post-deployment of your LLM based app.

This workshop focuses on understanding evaluation-driven development and architecture of a LLM based app, building an evaluation framework for a LLM based app, establishing a test suite with evals and laying the monitoring foundations for it. All of it by leveraging Python OSS libraries.

## Requirements
### General requrements
* basic Python knowledge
* basic understanding of ML testing
* basic understanding of ML monitoring
